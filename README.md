General Coding Assessment (4 Coding Tasks):
- Task 1: This focuses on working with numbers, basic string manipulation, and basic array manipulation and requires a combination of 2-3 of these concepts. Requires 5-10 lines of code and the average time for solving this task should be 10 minutes.

- Task 2: The focus is the same as the 1st task but with slightly more complex implementation and requires a combination of 3 to 5 the above-mentioned concepts. The solution typically requires writing 10-20 lines of code and the average time for solving this task should be 15 mins.

- Task 3: In addition to the knowledge demonstrated previously, this task will involve splitting a task into smaller subtasks/functions, manipulating two-dimensional arrays, and using hashmaps. You may be required to write 25-40 lines of code and the average time for solving this task should be 20 mins.

- Task 4: In addition to the knowledge demonstrated previously, this task will involve working with trees, understanding hashmaps, fundamentals of discrete mathematics, and brute-force search. You may be required to write 20-35 lines of code and the average time for solving this task should be 25 mins.

- Multiple Choice Quiz: For the quiz tasks, 8 topics are divided into 4 groups, each containing 4 quiz tasks. So, in total there are 16 quiz tasks. Questions will assess JavaScript fundamentals; Scopes, Hoisting and Closures; Exceptions, and Asynchronous operations; OOP, this and binding.
